 * have received all old operations via the recovery mechanism and are kept up to date by the various replications actions. The set of
 * shards that are taken into account for the global checkpoint calculation are called the "in-sync shards".
 * <p>

     * - replica: this shard receives global checkpoint information from the primary (see
     *   {@link #updateGlobalCheckpointOnReplica(long, String)}).
     *
     * When a shard is initialized (be it a primary or replica), it initially operates in replica mode. The global checkpoint tracker is
     * then switched to primary mode in the following three scenarios:
     *
     * - An initializing primary shard that is not a relocation target is moved to primary mode (using {@link #activatePrimaryMode}) once
     *   the shard becomes active.
     * - An active replica shard is moved to primary mode (using {@link #activatePrimaryMode}) once it is promoted to primary.
     * - A primary relocation target is moved to primary mode (using {@link #activateWithPrimaryContext}) during the primary relocation
     *   handoff. If the target shard is successfully initialized in primary mode, the source shard of a primary relocation is then moved
     *   to replica mode (using {@link #completeRelocationHandoff}), as the relocation target will be in charge of the global checkpoint
     *   computation from that point on.

     * handoff was successful or not. During the handoff, which has as main objective to transfer the internal state of the global
     * checkpoint tracker from the relocation source to the target, the list of in-sync shard copies cannot grow, otherwise the relocation
     * target might miss this information and increase the global checkpoint to eagerly. As consequence, some of the methods in this class

     * A notable exception to this is the method {@link #updateFromMaster}, which is still allowed to be called during a relocation handoff.
     * The reason for this is that the handoff might fail and can be aborted (using {@link #abortRelocationHandoff}), in which case
     * it is important that the global checkpoint tracker does not miss any state updates that might happened during the handoff attempt.
     * This means, however, that the global checkpoint can still advance after the primary relocation handoff has been initiated, but only
     * because the master could have failed some of the in-sync shard copies and marked them as stale. That is ok though, as this
