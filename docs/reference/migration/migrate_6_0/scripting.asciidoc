=== Scripting changes

==== Groovy, JavaScript, and Python languages removed

The Groovy, JavaScript, and Python scripting languages were deprecated in
elasticsearch 5.0 and have now been removed. Use painless instead.

==== Native scripts removed

Native scripts have been removed. Instead,
<<modules-scripting-engine, implement a `ScriptEngine`>>.

==== Date fields now return dates

`doc.some_date_field.value` now returns ++ReadableDateTime++s instead of
milliseconds since epoch as a `long`. The same is true for
`doc.some_date_field[some_number]`. Use `doc.some_date_field.value.millis` to
fetch the milliseconds since epoch if you need it.

==== Removed access to index internal via the `_index` variable

The `_index` variable has been removed. If you used it for advanced scoring, consider writing a `Similarity` plugin.

==== Script Settings

All of the existing scripting security settings have been removed.  Instead
they are replaced with `script.allowed_types` and `script.allowed_contexts`.

==== `lang` can no longer be specified when using a stored script as part of a request

The `lang` variable can no longer be specified as part of a request that uses a stored
script otherwise an error will occur.  Note that a request using a stored script is
different from a request that puts a stored script.  The language of the script has
already been stored as part of the cluster state and an `id` is sufficient to access
all of the information necessary to execute a stored script.

==== Stored search template apis removed

The PUT, GET and DELETE `_search/template` apis have been removed. Store search templates with the stored scripts apis instead.

For example, previously one might have stored a search template with the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /_search/template/my_template
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "f1": "{{f1}}"
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

And instead one would now use the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /_scripts/my_template
{
  "script": {
    "lang": "mustache",
    "source": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "f1": "{{f1}}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
