/**
 * This is a basic channel abstraction used by the {@link org.elasticsearch.transport.nio.NioTransport}.
 * <p>
 * A channel is open once it is constructed. The channel remains open and {@link #isOpen()} will return
 * true until the channel is explicitly closed.
 * <p>
 * A channel lifecycle has four stages:
 * <ol>
 * <li>UNREGISTERED - When a channel is created and prior to it being registered with a selector.
 * <li>REGISTERED - When a channel has been registered with a selector. This is the state of a channel that
 * can perform normal operations.
 * <li>CLOSING - When a channel has been marked for closed, but is not yet closed. {@link #isOpen()} will
 * still return true. Normal operations should be rejected. The most common scenario for a channel to be
 * CLOSING is when channel that was REGISTERED has {@link #closeAsync()} called, but the selector thread
 * has not yet closed the channel.
 * <li>CLOSED - The channel has been closed.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param <S> the type of raw channel this AbstractNioChannel uses
